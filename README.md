# student_intervention

## Project Description
There is a strong push to help increase the likelihood of students being successful in the classroom without watering down the education or engaging in behaviors that raise the likelihood of passing without improving the actual underlying learning. Graduation rates are often the criteria of choice for this; educators and administrators are after new ways to predict success and failure early enough to stage effective interventions, as well as to identify the effectiveness of different interventions. The objective of this project is to select and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, thus helping diagnose whether or not an intervention is necessary. The model is developed based on a subset of data that consists of information from randomly sample students, and it will be tested against a subset of the data that is kept hidden from the learning algorithm, in order to test the modelâ€™s effectiveness on data outside the training set.
